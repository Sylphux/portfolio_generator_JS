# About

This is a challenge given by a friend to learn JS. I have to create a working portfolio / resume generator.

## Status and functionnalities

The project is actually working if you only use the basic functions. You can successfully generate a CV / portfolio with it, but cannot export it.

You have the ability to save the content to your cookies with ctrl+s so you can come back later. It will keep your stuff saved.

If you want to download a PDF, press ctrl+e and then ctrl+p. Choose export to PDF with the right settings and it should match ! The style is done so it works well with 21 x 29.7mm paper

## What will come next

Here is a list of some implementations that will come next :

- Ability to save the HTML and style code to use the resume somewhere else
- Different themes for the resumes from which you can select your favorites
- Maybe some more styling overall
- Maybe I will do so that empty sections don't show at all in the render. For example, if you dont put contact information, the contact informations section will hide.
- Maybe an option to change the languages of the titles in the render, starting with adding french support

## Notes 

This project allowed me to discover how cookies work in JS and how to use JSON to store objects.
